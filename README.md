==========
A user authenticator module in PHP for use with MySQL and the mos/cdatabase module. You set options that fit your specific database table, salt and more. There will also be features for soft deletion of user after a specified amount of login attempts. Good posibility to expand and modify. This is mainly for the Anax-MVC framework but can be modified to fit anything.
